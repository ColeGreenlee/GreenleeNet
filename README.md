*Homelab documentation and guides with an abundance of emojis*

## :wave: Introduction

### :zap: About This Repository

Hello, and welcome to the repo! Since starting my own homelab, a project which I have dubbed 'GreenleeNet', I've been looking to document the process as a public project. A large portion of this repository will cover my homelab's current configuration, while also providing some insight on how the lab itself was initially developed. The main purpose of this is to help out friends, or anyone else on the internet, looking to set up a similar solution. 

### :boy: About Myself

My name is Cole Greenlee, and I'm a computer science student passionate about avoiding writing a decent bio for myself. I've been involved with software development for just over six years at this point , but would never consider myself an expert. I created this project as a learning experience, and to help some friends replicate portions of my setup.

### :warning: A Fair Warning

This repository is currently in an early stage of development, and should therefor be read with some caution. When I feel that it has reached a certain point of maturity, this warning will be removed. My goal is to produce ~10 sections to completion by the end of Summer 2019.
